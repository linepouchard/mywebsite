<h2>Projects</h2>
<br />

 <p><h6>ECP CODAR</h6></p><br />
 
 
<p><h6><A HREF="https://datacenterhub.org">CIF21 DIBBs: Building a Modular Cyber-Platform for Systematic Collection, 
Curation, and Preservation of Large Engineering and Science Data - 
A Pilot Demonstration Project. (NSF, 2014-2016)</A></h6></p>
<p>DataCenterHub provides a simple, standardized yet flexible platform to preserve and share 
scientific and engineering data produced by measurements and observations of structures undergoing stimuli in civil engineering.
We are improving scholarly communication in DataCenterHub by developing a metadata corpus and building co-author networks on issues of interest to the community.
</p><br />

<p><h6><A HREF="http://semanticportal.esipfed.org">ESIP Federation Semantic Portal</A></h6></p>
<p>The ESIP Semantic Portal provides a repository for Earth Sciences ontologies developed in OWL.  In collaboration with South Carolina
University, the portal deploys the NCBO Bioportal virtual appliance (ongoing since 2012).
</p><br />


<h6><A HREF="http://www.dataone.org">DataONE:</A> the Data Observation Network 
for Earth.
Co-founder and interim leader of the Data Integration and Semantics Working group.  </h6>
<p>DataONE is the foundation of new innovative environmental science 
through a 
distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure that meets the 
needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure 
access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data.  I improved data discovery in DataONE by 
1)providing linkages between an ontology repository and the Mercury search system, 2)using ontologies to expand queries, 
and 3)performing text mining to enrich DataONE metadata sets.  Sponsor:NSF (COMPLETED)
</p> <br />



<p><h6>Providing Rich Metadata Annotations for Earth Science Data. <A
HREF="http://rdav.nics.tennessee.edu/">Remote Data Analysis and
Visualization Center</A></h6></p>
<p>This effort seeked to enrich keywords in metadata documents by pairing
each document with another using various cosine similarity methods and
cross-populating keywords between members of the pair. Sponsor:NSF (COMPLETED) </p>
<br />


<h6>Enhancing Climate Impact Integrated Assessment for Water through 
Climate Informatics.</h6>
<p>Climate Informatics is the science of information applied to the study 
of climate change, its consequences and its impacts.  This project 
focuses on the integrated transformation of data and processes 
with an end-to-end, systemic approach, an emphasis on traceable, 
quality-controlled information, and scenario-based analyses using both 
observation and modeling data.  Sponsor: ORNL LDRD (COMPLETED).
</p>
<br />


<h6>A Framework for the Collection and Analysis of Large Datasets</h6>
<p>In this project, DCAT enables the collection, storage,
analysis, and display of sensor data to detect network and processor
failure in the next generation of HPC. RSS feeds are used to stream data
from heterogeneous sources. DCAT is currently undergoing parallelization
to run on a large cluster of Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)
machines. Sponsor: DOD, Extreme Scale Systems Center, ORNL (COMPLETED).</p>
<br />


<h6>Collection and Analysis Tools for the Intelligence Community (ORCAT I
and II)</h6>
<p>
ORCAT I and II are lightweight, desktop tools with a smooth,
easy-to-use interface. ORCAT I integrates functionality for building

searchable, personal, metadata-rich collections of Web content with the
ability to perform sophisticated queries. ORCAT II resolves open-ended
queries and highlights hidden relationships using RDF. Both were developed 
to facilitate the use of OSINT.

Internship (COMPLETED).

<br />

<h6>Group Violent Intent Modeling (GVIM)</h6>
<p>The ORNL team participated in the R & D of the GVIM Intelligence
Framework under the leadership of PNNL. At ORNL, we developed social 
science
ontologies, provided all intellectual content for a Social Science
Guidance Roadmap, and played an active role in the development of a
decision-assistance tool for the Intelligence Community. Sponsor: DHS (COMPLETED).
</p>
<br />

<h6>Data model for end-to-end simulations with Leadership Class Computing</h6>
<p>
Simulations, data and experts seamlessly participate as part of an
end-to-end interactive and adaptive discovery process, similar to
conventional experimental laboratories. We prototyped the CAFÃ‰ common
data model for storing and organizing provenance information and
hardware profiles of a given run. Cafe included metadata for Combustion
(S3D), Astrophysics (Chimera), Fusion GTC/XGC, and Environment) models. Sponsor: DOE Office of Science (COMPLETED).
</p>
<br />
 
<h6>The Virtual Autopsy</h6>
<p>The Virtual Autopsy project collected image data from combat fatalities
to research causes of trauma and better design protection systems for
soldiers. We developed GWAVA, an Information Retrieval Web application for the Virtual Autopsy.
Sponsor: DARPA. Acknowledgements: DOE Office of Science, 
Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (COMPLETED).
</p>
<br />

<h6>A Knowledge-Based Middleware and Visualization Framework for the Virtual Soldier</h6>
<p>
The Virtual Soldier Project investigated methods to represent and predict
physiological, electro-mechanical, and anatomical properties of
individual medical data on an electronic "dog tag" for assisting with care on the battlefield. The ORNL team
addressed complex aspects of data, information, and knowledge integration across VSP teams and modules as required for the modeling and visualization
of a disturbance of anatomical and physiological properties. Sponsor: DARPA (COMPLETED).
</p>
<br />

<h6> Sharing a World of Data: Scaling the Earth System Grid to Petascale</h6>
<p>
ESG is a project of the U.S. Department of Energy Scientific Discovery
through Advanced Computing program. ESG addresses the formidable
challenges associated with enabling analysis of and knowledge
development from global Earth System models. ESG is a virtual
collaborative environment that links distributed centers, users, models,
and data.  My contribution was the research and design of prototype
ontologies and active participation in the development of the
ESG metadata schema (COMPLETED).
</p>
<br />

<h6> Process Specification Language</h6>
<p>
PSL is an ontology and a specification language written in the Knowledge
Interchange Format (KIF) originally designed to express manufacturing and design processes.
PSL became a standard from the International
Standard Organization (ISO 18629), in the Industrial Automation Systems
and Integration, Industrial Data (SC4). Sponsor: the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
(COMPLETED).
